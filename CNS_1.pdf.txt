**Refined and Organized Text:**

**Cryptography Basics**
- **Plain Text:** The original message that the sender wants to communicate.
- **Cipher Text:** The message that is unreadable or meaningless to anyone except the intended recipient.
- **Encryption:** The process of transforming plain text into cipher text.
- **Decryption:** The reverse process of encryption, transforming cipher text back into plain text.
- **Key:** A unique numeric, alphanumeric, or symbolic value used in encryption and decryption.

**Cryptanalysis:** The study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the secret information required to do so, also known as codebreaking or cracking the code.

**Cryptography and Cryptanalysis in Network Security**
- Cryptography is a crucial aspect of network security, aiming to keep data secret.
- Cryptanalysis is the science or art of breaking cryptosystems.

**Cryptographic Algorithms**
- Symmetric Ciphers: Encryption and decryption use the same key.
- Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption.
- Hash Functions: One-way functions that produce a fixed-size output (hash) from any size input.

**Mutual Trust and Network/Computer Security**
- Mutual trust is essential for secure communication and data exchange.
- Network and computer security aim to protect automated information systems and their resources (hardware, software, firmware, data, and telecommunications) by preserving integrity, availability, and confidentiality.

**Levels of Impact from a Security Breach**
- **Low Impact:** Limited adverse effect on organizational operations, assets, or individuals.
- **Moderate Impact:** Serious adverse effect on organizational operations, assets, or individuals.
- **High Impact:** Severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, assets, or individuals.

**Security Requirements and Challenges**
- **Security Requirements:** Confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and non-repudiation.
- **Security Challenges:** Complexity, potential attacks, counterintuitive procedures, secret information, deployment decisions, battle of wits, perception, regular monitoring, and afterthought consideration.

**OSI Security Architecture (ITU-T X.800)**
- Defines a systematic way of defining and providing security requirements for open systems.
- Considers three aspects: security attacks, security mechanisms (controls), and security services.

**Security Services (X.800)**
- **Authentication:** Assurance that the communicating entity is the one claimed.
- **Access Control:** Prevention of unauthorized use of resources.
- **Data Confidentiality:** Protection of data from unauthorized disclosure.
- **Data Integrity:** Assurance that data received is as sent by an authorized entity.
- **Non-Repudiation:** Protection against denial by one of the parties in a communication.
- **Availability:** Resource accessible/usable.

**Security Mechanisms (X.800)**
- Specific security mechanisms: Encipherment, digital signatures, access controls, data integrity, authentication exchange, traffic padding, routing control, notarization.
- Pervasive security mechanisms: Trusted functionality, security labels, event detection, security audit trails, security recovery.

**Models for Network Security**
- **Transformation Model:** Design a suitable algorithm, generate secret information (keys), develop methods to distribute and share secret information, and specify a protocol enabling principals to use the transformation and secret information for a security service.
- **Network Access Model:** Select appropriate gatekeeper functions, implement security controls to ensure only authorized users access designated information or resources.

**Standards Organizations**
- National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST)
- Internet Society (ISOC)
- International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
- RSA Labs (de facto)

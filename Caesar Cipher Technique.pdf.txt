**Caesar Cipher Technique**

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique used to shift letters in the alphabet by a certain number of positions. It's one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption, also known as a substitution cipher. Here's how it works:

**Encryption Process:**
1. Write down the plaintext message.
2. Choose a shift value (n). In this case, let's use 3.
3. Replace each letter in the plaintext message with the letter that is 'n' positions down the alphabet. Wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. For example, with a shift of 3:
   - H becomes K
   - E becomes H
   - L becomes O
   - L becomes O
   - O becomes R
4. The encrypted message is now "KHOOR".

**Decryption Process:**
To decrypt the message, you simply shift each letter back by the same number of positions. In this case, you would shift each letter in "KHOOR" back by 3 to get the original message, "HELLO".

**Mathematical Representation:**
The Caesar cipher can be represented using modular arithmetic. For encryption, each letter is transformed to the scheme A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25, then the letter is replaced by the letter that is 'n' positions down the alphabet, wrapped around to the beginning if necessary. This can be described mathematically as:

En(x) = (x + n) mod 26

For decryption, each letter is shifted back by 'n' positions:

Dn(x) = (x - n) mod 26

**Example:**
Using the Caesar cipher to encrypt the message "HELLO" with a shift of 3:

- H becomes K
- E becomes H
- L becomes O
- L becomes O
- O becomes R

The encrypted message is now "KHOOR".

**History:**
The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials. It's one of the simplest forms of encryption, but it's also one of the easiest to break, as there are only 25 possible keys (shifts of 1 to 25).

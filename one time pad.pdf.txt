## One-Time Pad Algorithm

The One-Time Pad (OTP) algorithm, an improvement upon the Vernam Cipher, was proposed by Joseph Mauborgne, an Army Signal Corps officer. It is considered the only currently available algorithm that is truly unbreakable, offering complete security. This method encrypts alphabetic plaintext using a substitution technique, converting it into ciphertext. 

**Mechanism:**

1. **Character Assignment:** Each character in the plaintext is assigned a numerical value.
   
   | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |

   | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 |

   | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 |

2. **Key Generation:** A random key, equal in length to the plaintext message, is generated.

3. **Encryption:** Each plaintext character's numerical value is added to the corresponding key character's numerical value. If the sum exceeds 26, it wraps around (using modulo 26).

4. **Decryption:** The numerical value of each ciphertext character is subtracted by the corresponding key character's numerical value. Again, modulo 26 is used for wrapping around.

**Requirements:**

* **Random Key:** The key must be randomly generated and equal in length to the message.
* **Single Use:** The key is used only once to encrypt and decrypt a single message and is then discarded.

**Example:**

| **Input:** | Message = HELLO, Key = MONEY |
|---|---|
| **Output:** | Ciphertext = TSYPM |

**Explanation:**

**Part 1: Plaintext to Ciphertext**

1. **Numerical Representation:**
    * Plaintext (HELLO): 7 4 11 11 14
    * Key (MONEY): 12 14 13 4 24

2. **Addition (Modulo 26):**
    * 7 + 12 = 19 (T)
    * 4 + 14 = 18 (S)
    * 11 + 13 = 24 (Y)
    * 11 + 4 = 15 (P)
    * 14 + 24 = 38 = 12 (M) 

3. **Ciphertext:** TSYPM

**Part 2: Ciphertext to Plaintext**

1. **Numerical Representation:**
    * Ciphertext (TSYPM): 19 18 24 15 12
    * Key (MONEY): 12 14 13 4 24

2. **Subtraction (Modulo 26):**
    * 19 - 12 = 7 (H)
    * 18 - 14 = 4 (E)
    * 24 - 13 = 11 (L)
    * 15 - 4 = 11 (L)
    * 12 - 24 = -12 = 14 (O)

3. **Plaintext:** HELLO

**Try it yourself:**

* Input: Message = SAVE, Key = LIFE
* Output: Ciphertext = DIAI

**Security:**

The One-Time Pad's security relies on the key's randomness. 

* **Unpredictable Ciphertext:** A truly random key generates a truly random ciphertext, eliminating statistical patterns for cryptanalysis.
* **Brute-Force Ineffectiveness:** Even with brute-force attacks, all possible keys would produce seemingly legitimate plaintexts, making it impossible to determine the correct one.

**Advantages:**

* **Unbreakable:**  The only proven unbreakable encryption algorithm.
* **Ideal for High Security:** Suitable for low-bandwidth channels requiring extreme security, such as military communications.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Key Generation:** Generating large quantities of truly random keys is practically challenging.
* **Key Distribution:** Securely distributing keys of equal length to both sender and receiver for every message poses a significant logistical problem.
